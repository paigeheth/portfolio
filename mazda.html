    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Over 5 weeks, my team and I were tasked with identifying and solving
      a real-world implication of an experience design problem. We worked with
      Mazda Dealerships, leveraging the existing touch points of the MyMazda
      application to create a thoughtful experience for both the business
      and the end-users.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="step-information">
      <p>Our primary research uncovered that dealerships receive 50% of
        their revenue from their vehicle service department. Despite the
        benefit for the business, 85% of new Mazda owners do not visit
        their dealership for services because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>they perceive the dealership's prices as unfair</li>
        <li>the dealerships do not provide enough transparency correlating to a lack of trust</li>
        <li>they are unsure of what exactly the dealerships are providing and how long that will take</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>MyMazda</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="step-information">
      <p>In 2021, Mazda released the MyMazda application. Working with
        newer vehicle models, this app allows owners to control the
        functionality of their car, check the current vehicle status,
        and schedule service appointments through a third party.</p>

    <h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>Our intervention focuses on two parts. First, Mazda acknowledges
      that only 15% of their vehicle owners return for services. This means
      that there is an opportunity to gain the remaining 85% and therefore
      increase their revenue. Second, the current state of the MyMazda app
      relies on third parties (as shown below). We propose that this reliance
      prevents users from having a meaningful experience and connection with the app.</p>

  <h2>MyMazda (Redesigned)</h2> 
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>In our version of the MyMazda application, we considered the
      needs of both the business and the end user equally. Our app
      builds off the foundation of the current interface, adding
      in-house experiences that instil a thoughtful connection
      between Mazda and its customers.</p>

  <h2>Final Notes</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>We presented the final outcome to a panel of design professionals.
      The final design was well-received by critics. They noted our intervention 
      made sense for the industry, and they could see it being adopted by any dealership.
      I personally felt very accomplished by our design, and that we solved an issue that
      is present in the real-world.
