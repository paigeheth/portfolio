    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, my team and I worked with local brewery, House of Funk,
    to create the "Interactive Beer Lens". The goal of this project was to
    create an experience for customers that goes beyond the beer and allow
    customers to form a deeper connection with the brand.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-content-box">
    <h2>My Contributions</h2>
   <p>In this project, my contributions consisted of business and product
    research, copywriting, photography/photo retouching, and graphic
    design (creating illustrations in mockups, poster design).</p>

    <h2>Personas</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="step-information">
      <p>Through interviews with House of Funk's founder and four consumers,
        we gathered insights on consumer demographics, workplace culture,
        business frustrations, and opportunities for growth. From there,
        we identified three core personas that attend the brewery:
        the newcomer, the socialite, and the regular. Using product research,
        we coincided these identities with the core beers at House of Funk.</p>

  <h2>User Journey</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>Once we had an understanding of who our consumers were, we mapped
      both the socialite's and newcomer's journey. In the socialite's
      journey, we identified that their experience is repetitive and
      consistent. In the newcomer's journey, we identified that although
      they liked the atmosphere, they felt disconnected from the brewery
      which prohibited them from forming a meaningful connection with
      the brand.</p>
  
    <p>Here, we understood that for socialite's, <strong>their experience was consistent,
      which prevents them from exploring the other offerings of the brewery.</strong>
      Likewise, for newcomer's there was <strong>a disconnect between the pre-visit
      and in-house experience, which made it difficult for these customers
      to form a deep connection to House of Funk.</strong></p>

  <h2>Participant Group Workshop</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>Based on our reflection, past research, and initial concept mockups,
      we designed a workshop to better understand our participant group.
      This workshop had four participants: the brewery owner, the brand manager,
      a "socialite" consumer, and a "newcomer" consumer. The workshop was
      executed in two sessions to separate consumers and stakeholders and
      consisted of four activities: a photo collage, a mindmap, mash-up
      questions, and solution ideation.</p>
  
    <p>From the stakeholders, we observed their sense of love for the process
      of brewing and the aspect of sharing this love with the people who visit.
      From our consumers, we observed that they focused on the unique experience
      and environment that House of Funk provided. Both users and stakeholders
      were aligned in feeling that the best way to build a deeper connection
      between HOF and its users was through:</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>leveraging the existing touch points between staff and users, and</li>
      <li>presenting the various HOF products in a comprehensible or unique way.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>The Interactive Beer Lens</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>From the class feedback on our research and initial concepts, we created
      the "Interactive Beer Lens". Using augmented reality, we created a rich,
      in-house experience in the brewery using QR codes.</p>

  <h2>Intended Benefits of our Intervention</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <ul>
      <li>QR codes are dynamic/adaptable</li>
      <li>Experience is embedded in-house</li>
      <li>Low cost to implement</li>
      <li>Not a barrier to in-person interaction</li>
      <li>Experience is not offered by other breweries</li>

  <h2>Final Notes</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="step-information">
    <p>This project was paticularly interesting due to our direct involvement with the brewery. 
      Our solution was rooted in process, adapting with interviews and workshops. If I had more time
      with this project, I would love to test our solution in the brewery, and see how customers
      perceive our intervetion. Otherwise, I think we did come up with a thoughtful solution built
      on process.
